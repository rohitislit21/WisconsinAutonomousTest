Methodology
  I tried using OpenCV in order to capture the image processing using edge detection and contouring to try and find the cones in order to layout the perception algorithm
Libraries:
  I used opencv and numpy
What didn't work:
  I don't think that my code was able to identify the cones based on the comparative edges between the cones and that of the walls or ceilings.
